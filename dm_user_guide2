**Preface

Since user guides tend to be boring to write and then boring to read, we've tried to have fun writing this one and hopefully you'll have also fun reading it, in between you'll discover how Deepamehta works!

**Just imagine the computer would let you do what you want....

Normally when we think about things we make certain relations that for us are obvious, of course that I put the spare keys with the socks and  obviously the health care card is in the fridge  .. we know that we are not going to leave home without socks, so each time you pick some socks you will see where the spare keys are and since the fridge is full of healthy stuff that is the right place for the health care card to be.
Each one of us, make our own connections full of sense to us, so once we have made this connections we don't have to make an effort to think where to look for the keys or the health care card, our brain is quite happy not to be stressed by the fact of having to search all over the place when we look for the spare keys set or the health care card, it's able to go automatically to the right place. Less stress for the brain, less stress for us, the happier we are :-)

Probably you've chosen your connections based on some kind of situation, the last time you could not enter the house because you forgot the keys, you thought that if they had been with the socks you would not have forgotten them, clic! connection done.

Also there is no right way of establishing the connections, we use the one that fits for us, cool and happy, others will find other ways, sometimes you will share habits and you may change yours for something else that you consider better. When you live with people you find out that those connections are created collectively.

Now, comes the computer, this kind of black box that tells us how to organize things, nobody has asked us if that way makes sense for us,
you have to store you images in the images folder, well not quite, you can do it somewhere else but inside you user space, if you put them inside the configuration folders, probably at some point someone will yell at you. You also keep seeing all sort of files with strange names all over the place, that annoys you, you don't want to see them and you want to have them all together somewhere, if you proceed to do so probably the next time you try to start your computer it won't start, those strange files were configuration files and you'll think oh shi***!!!

But lets for a moment imagine that we don't have to care where the computer considers that the right place is, and that we are just able to make our own connections between the files that are in our computer. Imagine that we don't have to navigate through endless trees of folders to find things, having to make all kind of forced thinking to remember how once you decided to structure the tree.

Imagine  
  you could just define your own semantic relations
  that all the files could be treated it in the same way
  you could relate any kind of file with any kind of other file
  that you stop talking on terms of files and start talking about concepts
  that you could establish relations between one concepts on your own way

maybe then you could see what is in your mind, it sounds kind of cool, right? well that is what Deepamehta enables you to do, to forget about a working context based on applications and tree structured folders and to draw your way of thinking, well at least is on it's way to do it :-) ... 

** it sounds confusing, how can I draw my mind?

Yes, maybe at first it almost sounds like science-fiction, but that is how things evolve, first imagine them, then do them, as if it were that easy :-D

But let's stop talking and begin to see how DM works.

In the guide we won't cover the installation process, because that is already very good explained in the README file [https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#readme]. Here we will just remind you the way to start DM, it depends on your platform

deepamehta-linux.sh         # if you are under a GNU/Linux system choose "Run in terminal"
deepamehta-macosx.command   # if you are under MacOS double-click it
deepamehta-windows.bat      # if you are under Windows double-click it


So now you should be seeing this

Just to dive better in DM, a suggestion is to set your browser to full screen, so you enter in DM mode ;-)

We are not going to log in for the moment, so let's see what's on the screen. The screen is divided in three parts, a toolbar on the top, a right panel and a left panel. This screen divided in three is called the Deepamehta Webclient, and is the standard user interface for DM.

Before explaining each of them, we'll introduce a few DM concepts, the basic ones, the ones you are going to use all the time.

Workspace, which is the more general container of the information that you are going to have. You will be able to define as many       Workspaces as you want, you will be able to share "things" between workspaces. 

Topic map, is part of a Workspace and for the moment let's say is the visualization of the information that is important to you in the current moment.

So the toolbar in the top part  allows you to select and perform various operations. If you are not logged in,  you will be able to select your Workspace, your topic map, to search by name or by type an item that you know, access the help and the link to log in.

Summing up the panel on the left hand side will be where you will visualize your topic maps and on the right hand side, you will see the content and details of the topic map.

If you are not logged in, you will see the last topic map you were and you will be able to switch to different topic maps or workspaces and also to search for any kind of item that is in your DM world.

Now we'll log in to do some stuff, click on the login link and introduce "admin" as user and leave the password blank

Before we have said that in DM we could see what is in our mind, let's check how can we do that. We were saying that for us the right place to put the keys is with the socks, let's build a simple sentence with it's subject and verb.

Tina has keys which are in the drawer that contains socks.

This can be turned into 3 sentences.

Tina has keys.
Key are in a drawer
A drawer contains socks

So there we have 3 sentences with 3 subjects and 3 verbs.

In DM the subjects are called topics and the verbs are called associations.

*Remember* 
  Topics represent any concept, people, countries, organizations, software modules, individual files, events.
  Associations represent relationships between topics

Maybe it could look something like this

[dm_example01.png]


**How to do it

Go to the toolbar and click on the "Create" drop down list, where you'll see 4 default topic types: 
  Institution
  Note
  Person
  Web resource
  
 Oh wait, we didn't talk about topic types yet!!
 We've said that topics are concepts, and we group concepts by types.
 
 Topic types are topics grouped by type.
 
 So when we say that a topic type is "Institution" we are managing the general concept of Institution, that is a place or organization founded for a specific purpose. We can think that a hospital is an institution, a school is an institution, a theater is an institution. All of those places have a certain number of common features that define them, so in DM when you select the topic type "Institution" you'll see those common default features (a name, an address, a mail, a url). The same happens with the rest of topic types.
 
 In our example we've created one topic type "Person", which is Tina. Tina is a person so it has certain common features with the rest of Humanity, a name, a last name, a phone, an email, a URL, an address (all optional). Then we've created 3 topic types "Note", which are kind of a wildcard, simple topics with a name and a description. 
 
  
 [dm_example03.png]
 
 
 So now we have the topics but the topics alone don't make much sense, so we need to create the associations, that is how are those topics related.
 
First we wanted to say that Tina has keys (specifically a spare set of keys), for that we have to right clic on topic Person Tina, where a menu with display and we will see the "Associate" option, we will clic on it
 
  [dm_example04.png]
  
  
A line will appear and you have to drag it to the topic with which we want to create the association, in our case topic Person Tina has to be associated with Topic Note Keys

   [dm_example05.png]
 
 another cool thing we can do is to name the association, because associations are also editable, 
 
 [dm_example06.png]
 
 so that we can actually read the sentence that we have in our mind. As a practice, we will use verbs in infinitive, so that is general, in our case name this association "to have" 
 
  [dm_example07.png]

so now we can see "Tina has keys"

  [dm_example08.png]
  
We proceed in the same way with the other topic types, we create the association between keys and drawer, and then between drawer and socks. So at the end we will have 

 [dm_example02.png]
 
 

so you are now creating your first topic map, cool!!!


*Remember* 
  All topics and associations exist independently of topic maps and are stored centrally in the corporate memory (CM). 
  Topic maps are personalized views of extracts of the CM. Virtually every topic can be made visible in every topic map.


Now that you've remembered that DM is more like a brain let's continue, we have a nice photo from Tina. Ok that we want to associate it with her topic Person.
Go to the toolbar, click on the drop-down menu Create, there you will see "New File Browser", on the Detail panel on the right side you will see the File Browser and you'll recognize your computer's tree structure, browse until you select the photo you are looking for.


 [dm_example09.png]

You will see that a lot of topics and associations begin to appear with each click you make, it's drawing the path that your brain is making while remembering how did you organize your files till it get's you to the photo. At some point, the canvas may "move down" to find space to draw everything, but one the canvas is infitive so there is no problem of space here :). Once you've selected the photo, you'll see it on the Detail Panel :). Now you can associate it with the topic type Person Tina, right click on the Photo associate and drag to topic type Person-Tina.


 [dm_example12.png]

Ok, you've made the relation but now there are lot of topic and associations that you don't really want to see, so it's time to Hide things, right click on each of the topic and click on Hide, hidding the topic will hide also the association, if at some point you want to see the topic but not the association, you can right click on the association, click hide and then just the association will be hidden. 


 [dm_example13.png]


Repeat this operation with all the topics that you want to hide and you'll have a clearer screen :D


 [dm_example14.png]


**Remember**
  Topic maps do not show all the information that is there, only the information that is relevant to you in the moment that you are working.
